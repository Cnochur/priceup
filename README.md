# PriceUp

### A simple PWA for pricing jobs, in this case, Blinds and Plantation Shutters.
**This will be used by a family member for their business.**
---

## Goal

The user wants a simple way for pricing jobs from the excel files that they have. 
---

## Plan

Build a simple, responsive web app that the user can install on mobile or desktop.
---

The app itself will be a simple python flask script that will allow the user to upload the csv [**and excel in the future**] documents that contain the pricing 'matrix'.

It will then process and clean the data using a seperate data cleaning script using python and pandas.

Final use case will look like this: Take in individual window measurements (as its focused on blinds) and produce a list containing the window details and individual price that has been generated via the data set that was cleaned.

Can then save this in the database.


## Tech Stack

- ### Frontend: 
    HTML, CSS, Js
- ### Backend
    Flask
- ### Database
    SQLite


## Personal Goals

I want to build this app with using nothing but the original documentation of the technologies aka **no AI**. 

I have built a somewhat solid enough knowledge base over the past few months but this has led me to use AI as a mentor and sometimes as an easy way out. I have some personal projects that I am working on and I want to be proud of my work and not feel like a fraud.
